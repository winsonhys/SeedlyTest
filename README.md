I created components that I thought would showcase my frontend engineering ability. I also took this task up as if I were doing a JIRA ticket. I particularly made use of typescript as I value typesafety a lot. Having done react native
and not having type safety was a pain in the ass.

On the server side, the data structure should idealy be all arrays to simulate sql rows, but I used objects instead to make my job easier as it is not emphasized in the question.

I could also add tests into the app (Jest or Mocha), but it wasnt specified that I had to do so, hence I did not. I've learnt to not be "smart" and do something outside of the ticket specifications.


Designs were also not the main focus and hence I left out the fancy header and the "Ask a Question" thing since its also not part of the ticket.

I also left out "Trending" since its literally the same as Recent Activity with just another filter on top of it.

PS: I loved this challenge! I feel that it would better assess a person's engineering ability instead of some random coding quiz.
